# Employee-Survey-Analysis

### Project Overview
Project Overview
This project evaluates employee feedback across departments and roles to understand satisfaction levels, agreement patterns, and areas for improvement. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to boost employee satisfaction and engagement. Key questions guiding the analysis include:
- Which survey questions did respondents agree or disagree with most?
- Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?
- As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

### Key Metrics
- Respondents: 15,000
- Responses: 57,000
- % Agreement: 77% 
- % Disagreement: 23% 
- Average Response Score: 3.07

### Skills Used
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Power BI Features (DAX Calculations and Measures)
- Employee sentiment analysis (Agreement vs. Disagreement)
- Dashboard/Data Storytelling

### Analysis
1. Most Agreed and Disagreed Questions; Using DAX measures, we quantified employee sentiment: % Agreement captured positive responses (Agree + Strongly Agree), while % Disagreement captured negative responses (Disagree + Strongly Disagree). This allowed us to tell a clear story about workplace satisfaction:
- High Agreement Areas: Employees strongly agreed they know what is expected of them at work (93%) and feel supported and cared for by supervisors or colleagues (83%), highlighting clarity in roles and effective managerial support.
- The Most Disagreed Questions Were:
“I have a best friend at work” – 48% disagreement, indicating limited close workplace connections.
“In the last seven days, I have received recognition for doing good work” – 35% disagreement, highlighting gaps in acknowledgment and recognition practices.

2. Department and Role Trends
- Departments: Emergency Management and Human Services had high agreement (>80%), while Economic Development scored lower (<70%), revealing department-specific differences in satisfaction.
- Roles: Directors and managers reported slightly higher agreement than staff and supervisors, suggesting frontline employees may experience more challenges or unmet needs.

3. Insights
- Employees understand their roles and appreciate managerial support, yet gaps exist in workplace relationships and recognition. Department and role trends help pinpoint where interventions will be most effective. By using DAX measures to quantify agreement and disagreement, we can identify precise areas for improvement and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing employee satisfaction and engagement.

### Conclusion
The analysis shows that overall employee satisfaction is moderate, with employees generally understanding their roles and appreciating support from direct supervisors. However, gaps exist in workplace relationships (48% disagreed that they have a best friend at work) and recognition (35% disagreed that they received acknowledgment in the last seven days). Department and role trends reveal that some areas and frontline staff experience more challenges than others, highlighting where targeted interventions are needed.

### Recommendation
- Improve Workplace Connections: Encourage team-building activities and peer interactions to strengthen workplace relationships.
- Enhance Recognition Programs: Implement regular acknowledgment of good work, such as weekly shout-outs, awards, or feedback sessions.
- Resource & Career Development: Provide adequate tools, training, and mentorship programs to support employee growth, especially in departments with lower satisfaction.
- Department-Specific HR Strategies: Conduct workshops or focus groups tailored to specific departments to address unique challenges.
- Continuous Monitoring: Run pulse surveys regularly to track progress, measure the impact of interventions, and adjust strategies as needed.
